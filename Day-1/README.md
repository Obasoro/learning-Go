# My Go Journey

Go uses a binary compilation system. During installation, make sure the environment is properly called or exported.

# After Installation
 Run the following command
 go version
 go
 go env # this would inform the exact part and location of go 

# with Vscode
Installing the other dependencies with vscode is made easier

How to find the env

go env GOPATH

go --help useful in searching for documentation
